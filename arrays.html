      <h1>Arrays</h1>
      <br />
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>Arrays are one of the most used and useful data structures in programming. Basically,
          an array is a collection of elements identified by at least one index or key.</p>
        <p>
          In this section, I will present some algorithms to shuffle, sort and search in arrays.
          This is the basis of algorithms, arrays are used in many other more complex problems and be able
          to implement these simple functions is a very important skill to a developer. So, there is my
          motivation to this page and to Algorythm, understand data structures and algorithms to always know
          what is going on under the hood.

      <h2>Sort algorithms</h2>
      <br />
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>
          Sort algorithms are used to put the elements of an array into an logical order. This is a very
          important feature, once other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) require input data
          to be in sorted lists. Because of that, optimization and efficiency are very important here.
          Let's take a look and visualize how some algorithms sort the data in an array.
        </p>
      </div>
      <br />
      <h3>Bubble Sort</h3>
      <br />
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>
          Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps
          through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through
          the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way
          smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
        </p>
        <p>
          This simple algorithm performs poorly in real world use and is used primarily as an educational tool.
        </p>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="flexbox sampleBars">
        <div id='bubbleSort_canvas'></div>
        <div class='control_canvas'>
          <button onClick='BubbleSort.sort(bubbleSort_array)'>Sort</button>
        </div>
      </div>
      <br />
      <h3>Insertion Sort</h3>
      <br />
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>
          Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.
          It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge
          sort.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Pseudocode to sort an array of size n in ascending order:
        <ol>
          <li>Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array.</li>
          <li>Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor.</li>
          <li>If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before.
            Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and
          placed at the correct position in the sorted part. It's like the Bubble Sort, but instead the larger elements
          "bubble" to the top, the smaller elements seems to "sink" to their right positions.
        </p>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="flexbox sampleBars">
        <div id='insertionSort_canvas'></div>
        <div class='control_canvas'>
          <button onClick='InsertionSort.sort(insertionSort_array)'>Sort</button>
        </div>
      </div>
      <br />
      <h3>Selection Sort</h3>
      <br />
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>
          selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(n2) time complexity, which makes it
          inefficient
          on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its
          simplicity
          and has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where
          auxiliary
          memory is limited.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to
          right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of
          the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The
          algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted
          sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving
          the sublist boundaries one element to the right.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          One thing which distinguishes selection sort from other sorting algorithms is that it makes the minimum
          possible number of swaps, nâˆ’1 in the worst case.
        </p>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="flexbox sampleBars">
        <div id='selectionSort_canvas'></div>
        <br />
        <div class='control_canvas'>
          <button onClick='SelectionSort.sort(selectionSort_array)'>Sort</button>
        </div>
      </div>
      <br />
      <h3>Merge Sort</h3>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>
          Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer comparison-based algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves,
          calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. Every recursive algorithm is dependent
          on a
          base case and the ability to combine the results from base cases. Merge sort
          is no different. The most important part of the merge sort algorithm is merge step. The merge step is the
          solution
          to the simple problem of merging two sorted lists(arrays) to build one large sorted
          list(array).
