        <p>
          A maze is a path, or collection of paths, that tipically lead from an entrance to a goal.
          Mazes have been a widely studied topic in Computer Science, with many algorithms
          dedicated to building and solving them. Various data structures can represent mazes and labyrinths,
          like graphs, trees and, in the case of Algorythm, bidimensional arrays (matrixes).

          find a path to solve them.

      <h2>Recursive Backtrack</h2>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>
          Backtracking is a sort of refined brute force used to be a selective graph traversal method.
          Imagine a graph/tree representing a initial position (the root node) and a final goal
          (one of the leaves), and we want to find this leave. So, we could brute-force the
          nodes and paths until reach the goal, but depending on the graph weight a raw brute-force approach
          would explode into an impossible number of choices to consider and inviabilize our task. It is the kind
          of situation where the recursive backtracking becomes useful.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Using backtracking, at each node we can eliminate bad choices that are obviously the wrong answer
          and proceed to recursively check only those that have potential. This way, at each depth of
          the tree, we mitigate the number of choices to consider in the future.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf
          by revoking your most recent choice, and trying out the next option in that set of options.
          If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try another choice at
          that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Backtracking is very useful for solving trivial problems like Sudoku, crosswords and queens.
          However, here we will use Recursive Backtrack for a more restricted problem: generate randomic mazes.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          By choosing random directions and building "bridges" between nodes, the Backtracking is one of the most
          simpler methods to generate mazes. It works in these steps:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>Start a bidimensional array where all nodes are walls;</li>
          <li>Choose a root node as start point and make it a path;</li>
          <li>
            Randomly choose a direction to pick a neighbor node. Check if it hasn't already been visited
            (check if the node is a wall);
          </li>
          <li>
            Move two units (nodes) in that direction, setting both the forward node and the link node to paths;
          </li>
          <li>Call the function recursively with the new forward node's (x,y) coordinates;</li>
          <li>
            Repeat until reach a dead end;
            <ul>
              <li>If during step three you found that all of your directions contained paths, you need to backtrack;
              </li>
              <li>
                To backtrack, we are going to exit the current function call. This means we are moving backwards
                into the previous function which had initially moved us into this current node until we find a path.
                Once we find a new path, we go to step three.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Let's draw step by step to help understand this algorithm:

      <h2>Prim's Algorithm</h2>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>
          The other algorithm for maze generation that I will show here is the Prim's algorithm.
          Prim's is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a undirected graph.
          In other words, the algorithm finds a subgraph from the main graph where the total
          weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized and all vertex are connected.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Prim's algorithm was developed in 1930 by Czech mathematician Vojtěch Jarník - just to emphasize,
          the first eletronic computer was built in 1942 - and later rediscovered and republished
          by computer scientists Robert C. Prim in 1957 (that gives name to it) and Edsger W. Dijkstra (another
          scientist well known for his algorithms) in 1959.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          To simplify, lets analyse a practical example. Imagine five cities connected by dirt roads, like
          in the first figure of the graph below (buildings are cities and dashed lines are roads, the numbers are the
          length of the road). So, we want to pave the roads in a way that all cities are interconnected using the least
          amount of asphalt possible. This is exactly the kind of problem that Prim's algorithm becomes useful, once it
          finds the shorter path that connect all vertices. If we apply the algorithm in this problem, the result is
          in the next sequence (the orange city is the source vertice, where the algorithm starts, and the red edges
          are the paved roads).
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="flexbox">
          <img class="prims-img" src="assets/prims-graph.png" />
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          But, the example above is for graphs. Here we are working with bidimensional matrixes, and the algorithm
          needed some adaptation to work for this purpouse. So, if the Prim's use is connect vertices through edges, we
          can also use it to generate randomic mazes. In fact, it is a simple algorithm, these are the steps I followed
          to program it:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>Start with a bidimensional array full of cells in state Blocked (walls).</li>
          <li>
            Pick a source cell, set it to state Passage and compute its frontier cells. A frontier
            cell of a Cell is a cell with distance 2 in state Blocked and within the grid.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the list of frontier cells is not empty:
            <ol>
              <li>Pick a random frontier cell from the list of frontier cells.</li>
              <li>
                Get all neighbors from this frontier cell. A neighbor from a cell are all cells in distance
                2 in state Passage and within the grid.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pick a random neighbor and connect the frontier cell with the neighbor by setting
                the cell in-between to state Passage.
              </li>
              <li>Compute the frontier cells of the chosen frontier cell and add them to the frontier list.</li>
              <li>Remove the chosen frontier cell from the list of frontier cells.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>A Cell (node) has 2 states: Blocked or Passage.</li>
            <li>We use 2 for distance because we need to consider the walls as a integer cell of the grid</li>
          </ul>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <p>
          Now, we can see the Prim's generating random mazes in practice:

      <h2>A* Pathfinding</h2>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>
          The A* is an algorithm for pathfinding. It searchs the ideal path in a graph from an initial vertex
          to a goal vertex. It is very useful and used, its applications ranges from apps to find commuting routes
          between locations to solving problems, such as solving a puzzle (a maze, for example) and is very used in
          videogames. Although it isn't the fastest of the algorithms for pathfinding in the best cases, the A* has
          the most consistent performance in different scenarios and puzzles.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The algorithm was first described in 1968 by Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson, and Bertram Raphael. It is a kind of
          combination of the heuristics from Breadth First Search (BFS) and the formality of the Dijkstra's algorithm.
          The A* works based on the concept of cost, where each vertex has a value associated depending on distance,
          obstacles, terrain, etc. This feature makes the A* very flexible and expands considerably its usage
          possibilities.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          For example, imagine a game where a NPC have to calculate the best route from a start to a final point.
          Well, any pathfinding algorithm can handle that, but what if our game's map has a big river where the NPC
          moves very slowly, and now the best path is passing by a bridge? Algorithms that consider just the edges in
          an euclidean logic aren't the best choice in this case. Using A*, in the other hand, is the ideal choice.
          To accomplish the task of finding the route even with different terrains and obstacles, it is enough to add
          a higher cost to the paths that present disadvantage to the NPC. Then, when the NPC calculate the route it
          will consider the lower cost path.
        </p>
        <p>
          For our maze solving, two costs were considered:
        <ul>
          <li><b>G: </b>the cost to move to the next node;</li>
          <li><b>H: </b>the estimated cost (heuristic) to move from the source node to the goal;</li>
          <li><b>F: </b>the sum of G and H.</li>
        </ul>
        So, G is the cost for moving from the current node to another adjascent node. It helps determine the next
        step the path will follow. H, in fact, is a guessing. The H cost measure the distance from the source node
        to the target node - by the way, the A* only works when you already know your origin and your destination -,
        but, actually, we don't know the real distance until we know what path to follow (and it is exactly what
        we are trying to do) because the route may have obstacles, walls and other things that we can't predict.
        So, to determine the H cost we can use some heuristic that measure this distance. In this algorithm I've
        used two different heuristics for the purpose of comparison: the euclidean distance and the manhattan
        distance. Finally, the F cost is what drives our algorithm. The node with the smaller sum of G and H (F) is
        the next node for our path.
        </p>

        <br />
        <div class="flexbox">
          <ul>
            <li><b>Euclidean Distance: </b>is the length of a line segment between two points.</li>
            <li>
              <b>Manhattan Distance: </b>the sum of the absolute differences between two vectors. In other words,
              is the distance disconsidering diagonals and percorring just straight paths.

      <div class="textbox">
        <p>
          The A* algorithm is a bit complex, these are the steps I followed to implement it:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            First, create two arrays, the open and closed. The open array is, basically, a list with the nodes
            that we need to verify if will be part of our path or not. The closed array is a list with the nodes
            that we've already checked;
          </li>
          <li>Add the source node to the open list;</li>
          <li>
            Repeat:
            <ol>
              <li>Pick the node with the lower F cost in open list. This is our current node;</li>
              <li>Move the current node to closed list;</li>
              <li>For each one of the 8 adjascent nodes of the current node:
                <ul>
                  <li>If the neighbor node isn't passable or if it is in the closed list, ignore. Else:
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        If isn't in the open list, add the node to it. Make the current node the parent
                        of this node. Calculate and save the costs F, G and H of this node.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        If the node already is in the open list, check if the G cost of this node is lower
                        going by this path. If so, change this node's parent to the current node and update
                        the G and F costs of this node.
                      </li>
                    </ol>

            Stop when:
            <ul>
              <li>Add the target node to the closed list (have found the path), or</li>
              <li>Don't find the target node and the open list is empty. In this case,
                there is none path.
